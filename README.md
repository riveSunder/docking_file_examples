Figuring out how to generate `.maps.fld` files for use with AutoDock can be a bit tricky. If you just want to try out AutoDock without messing with autogrid and the other support scripts from AutoDockTools, this is your starting point. This repo is simply the prepared `.pdbqt` and `.maps.fld` for quickly testing out docking programs. The protein-ligand pair is acetycholinesterase and its inhibitor, Huperzine. The PDB structure id is [1gpk](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1GPK)
